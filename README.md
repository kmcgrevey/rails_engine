Rails ENGINE is the API backend for Rails DRIVER.  I am using the default Rails DRIVER for spec harness testing from Turing (at: https://github.com/turingschool-examples/rails_driver)

To start your local copy:

* Rails Engine --> `bundle exec rake import` --> seed database

* Rails Engine --> `rails s` (to start server)

* Rails Driver -- `rails s -p 3001` (to start server)

* New browser window --> `localhost:3001` (to use app)
